## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gamified-education-platform
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy example env file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit the .env file with your database URL and JWT secret
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend API (port 5000) and frontend React app (port 3000).
